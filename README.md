# Mini_Projects
This is just a repository to showcase some of the Mini Projects I have worked. There is no specific genre here. Just a mix of little projects I have worked on for various purposes.

Included here:

Rock, Paper, Scissors Tournament Simulation: 
This is a small script I wrote to simulate the outcomes of a rock, paper, scissors tournament where each player could only play one match a day. Victory would be determined by elimination through random matching. It runs a simple pseudo randomized match simulation and attempts to statistically predict how long a tournament would take given a specified number of players.

Photon-Axion Time Delayed Signal Calculator:
This is a small piece of software I wrote to test the validity of a method of Axion detection I came up with. It calculates the time delay expected if photons convert into an axion near its source and re-convert in our local galactic field, and then estimates the time difference between the arrival of un-converted photons and re-converted photons. If this time delay is significant enough, this would allow us to search for axions using specific time delayed signal methodolgies.
